WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <microblaze_i/dlmb_LMB_ABus<31>> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <microblaze_i/dlmb_LMB_ABus<30>> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:1245 - Unexpected DCM_ADV configuration. The signal
   clk_generator_0/clk_reg on the CLKIN pin of DCM_ADV comp
   microblaze_i/clock_generator_0/clock_generator_0/DCM0_INST/Using_DCM_ADV.DCM_
   ADV_INST is not driven by an IOB, BUFG or BUFGCTRL therefore the phase
   relationship of output clocks to CLKIN cannot be guaranteed.

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Total CPU time to MAP completion:   10 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
