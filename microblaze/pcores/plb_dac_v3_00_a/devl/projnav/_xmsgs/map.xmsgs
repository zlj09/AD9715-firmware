<msg type="info" file="MapLib" num="797" delta="new" >Your design is targeting <arg fmt="%s" index="1">LX/SX Production Step 0/1/ES</arg> devices. Please note that there are new specifications for the DCMs to guarantee maximum frequency performance. If the DCM input clock might stop or if the DCM reset might be asserted for an extended time, then use of the dcm_standby macro may be required. Please see Answer Record 21127.
